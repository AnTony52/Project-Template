# Project-Template
<ul>
  <li>I have set up a template for basic projects that only uses HTML, CSS(SCSS), JS.</li>
  <li>The valueble part of this template is the mixin.scss file, which is contain most reusable mixins.</li>
  <li>And thanks to grunt's ability that compressing and optimizing the source, it increases the website's Google PageSpeed point.</li>
</ul>
<p>So happy coding ^^</p>
I'll continue to updating with the valuable changes <3
