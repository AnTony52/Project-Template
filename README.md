# This is a Project-Template
<p>I have set up an grunt template for basic projects that only uses html, css and js.</p>
<p>The valueble part of this template is the mixin.scss file, which is contain reusable mixins.</p>
<p>And thanks to grunt's ability to compress and optimize the source, it increases the website's Google PageSpeed point. </p>
<p>So happy coding ^^</p>

I'll continue to updating with the valuable changes <3
